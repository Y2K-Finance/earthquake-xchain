# earthquake-xchain

The cross-chain zapper lets users bridge then deposit to a Y2K vault or withdraw funds from the vault that was previously deposited via the zapper - on the fromChain. In addition, the fromChain zapper allows users to swap their tokens on UniswapV2, UniswapV3, Balancer, or Curve before they are bridged to be deposited.
